VP of Climate at Supercritical, a start-up focusing on helping businesses achieve net zero, speeding up decarbonisation and scaling-up carbon removal.

Leading researcher in the intersection of land use & climate change, science & implementation. Experienced in stakeholder management, team leadership, delivering large projects and communication.

Passionate about protecting a habitable climate and (what is left of) the natural world.

I am a highly cited researcher in sustainable food systems, with experience in policy and industry who bridges science, policy and industry. I have a strong interdisciplinary research background with PhD from Cambridge University. I received the RSPB medal for scientific work of highest importance for nature conservation, for my work on the importance of food system thinking for climate change and conservation objectives.

I have appeared on BBC One, BBC Radio 4 Today and World Service on the topics of climate change, diets and food waste.
